# Badger 2040 for Public Health

## About this project

The Badger 2040 is a really neat device that puts a programmable python-based OS on to a credit-card sized device that comes complete with some buttons (essentially a D pad + enter) and a small e-ink screen. 

Key features are

* This can be used as a data entry or health records device for research and clinical trials.
* It's modifiable, so adding sensors, clocks etc is possible
* It has a proper screen, so you can make things interactive
* As an extreme low-power solution, the device has a lot of potential for use in settings where there's limited or no power grid.

## Our aim

With this project, we're trying to figure out what we can do with Badger 2040 in public health settings. 

### About the code

### Examples

* Our first test is a pretty simple electronic diary, intended to collect daily data about menstruation health.
