pip3 install Pillow

Download the pimoroni-pico repo to your computer: 

git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico

Navigate to the image converter tool: 

cd pimoroni-pico/examples/badger2040/image_converter

Then, assuming your starting image file is in the same directory as 'convert.py', you can convert it like this (adding in your own file names): 

python3 convert.py --binary --resize image_file_1.png

creates .bin file
